I first added a new section in the html to display player turn and number of matches. Then, I declared new variables in the JavaScript for current player and player scores. I update these in the necessary places, like after there is a correct or inccorrect match and when the game resets. Finally, I created a function that updates the player turn display and an alert that displays the score, time and moves when the game is finished. It appears to be working exactly as described in new_feature.md.
