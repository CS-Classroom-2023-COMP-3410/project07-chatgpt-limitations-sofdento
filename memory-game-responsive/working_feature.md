In the css file, I added a game wrapper element that encloses both the fruit border and the game container, changed the fruit border posision from fixed to absolute, and changed the game container's width to a clamp. I also changed the z index of the game container to appear above the border without hiding it. In the JavaScript file, I modified the generation of the fruit border to reference the new game wrapper, removed some of the inline style overrides that interfered with the responsive css.
